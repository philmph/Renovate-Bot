## Configuration Confusion

If someone comes by this repository and can explain to me why `branchPrefix:` and `gitAuthor:` can be used in the `config.js` while they are settings listed in [Configuration - Repository](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/) and not [Configuration - Self-hosted](https://docs.renovatebot.com/self-hosted-configuration/).. i'll gift you a beer.
